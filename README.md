# Portfolio_FullStack
A custom programming portfolio using Django.

### Functionality
It is hosted on heroku, media files stored on amazon s3, and static files stored on heroku using white noise. It has a login feature so that I can add project entires by signing in to the webapp. This porfolio functions more closely to a blog. It also has views locked behind a login so that I perform administrative tasks without having to code. [Check out the live version here.](https://achan-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)
